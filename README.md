# mossviz

A simple moss visualization tool. Currently works only for C++ projects, but there are plans to adapt it for other languages supported by moss. This can also be done manually by editing the `mossviz.py` file.

## Requirements and Usage

The `mossviz.py` must be called in a directory with the following file structure: 

- `base/` This is the directory that contains all the base files for the project. 
- `submissions/` The directory that contains all the submissions. In this directory, each submission should be a directory with some ID for the student, containing all the files for the project. 

To call `mossviz.py`, you must have a moss id and add it into the file locally. This id can be generated by emailing the moss administrators. 

Once `mossviz.py` is called, a `mossdata.csv` file is created. Once this is prepared, use `generate_graph.py` to generate a graph of the data. Currently the parameters must be tweaked from within the file.
